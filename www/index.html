                <li>Put the <cite>Instant Page Messer</cite> button on the task bar of you web browser.</li>

                <li>Hit the <cite>Instant Page Messer</cite> button you previously put on the task bar of you web browser.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you do this right, the web page shouldn't behave anymore the way it is supposed to.</p>
