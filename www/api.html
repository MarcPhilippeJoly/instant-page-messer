        <h3>The heck</h3>
        <p>
            Instant Page Messer let you plug custom effects to be possibly applied to pages as any build-in Instant Page Messer effects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instant Page Messer also provide useful pre-computed values to be used when programming such plugin, so they don't have to be computed again by each plugin.
        </p>
        <h3>How to</h3>
        <h4>Building a custom plugable effect for Instant Page Messer</h4>
        <h5>Minimal requirements</h5>
        <p>
            Any method (aka Javascript "function") that returns a booleanish value is a valid plugable effect for Instant Page Messer.
        </p>
        <p>
            This booleanish value is used by Instant Page Messer to decide wether to call this method again as next animation frame or not. Truy values are for calling again; falsy are for not calling again. In all cases, Instant Page Messer may call a pluged effect anytime the user request messing with the displayed page.
        </p>
        <p>
            This let programmers program one shot effects by always returning a falsy value. It also let them program animations that stop only under certain conditions.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h5></h5>
        <h4>Plug a custom effect to Instant Page Messer</h4>
        <p>
            Custom effect plugin is achieved by calling <code>InstantPageMesser.plug()</code> with an animation method (JavaScript "function") as only parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any JavaScript "function" is an animation method for Instant Page Messer as long as it returns <code>true</code> to run again and <code>false</code> to definitely stop.
